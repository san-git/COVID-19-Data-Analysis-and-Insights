# COVID-19-Data-Analysis-and-Insights

There is a huge opportunity of Machine Learning use cases to help community during this COVID-19 crisis. There are mutliple datasets are avilable and lots of work is going on the analysis of those dataset. In this repository I am trying to analyze COVID-19 research data and comeup with some useful insights. 

## Installation

No extra libraries needs to be installed as all the libraries used here comes up with the Anaconda distribution with Python3.6. All the libraries can refered in the notebook under import libraries section.

## Project Motivation 

Data Science will be key to deal to with COVID-19 crisis during and after, lots of researcher are putting their work online and there are lots of data to analyze to come up with insights and machine learning can be the only way to learn pattern out of it that will help the scientist and doctors.

## File Descriptions 

The jupyter notebook is the only code file that has all the code.

## How To Interact With Your Project 

Fork the repository and contribute on other ideas to analyze for more ML use case around incident managent.

Currently the Dataset is used from Kaggle:-https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge

But in future more dataset from multiple sources will be used, few sources are list below:-
